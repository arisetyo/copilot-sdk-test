## Temporary notes

- We still need Copilot CLI installed in machine/server and authorized it using your Github account.

- Only use Copilot SDK for developing agentic features. If using a straightforward pipeline like RAG, OpenAI + LangChain is still a better option.

- With that said, adding agentic in your web app is a breeze. Copilot does all the heavy lifting.

- This SDK is pretty new. The models I'm using in VS Code Copilot doesn't really understand how it works. I have to add documentation files in the workspace for it to understand how to use it.

- Article should add those information as well as providing important code snippets (readers can see the full code in a Github repo).

- The "Form-Filling Agent" concept is available in a separate document: `docs/concept_form-filling_agent.md`.
